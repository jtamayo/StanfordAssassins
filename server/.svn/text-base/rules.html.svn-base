        <h1>Stanford Assassins Rules</h1>
		<h4>Goal</h4>
		<div>
			Stay alive... If you can.
			The main goal of an assassins game is to be the last person alive when the game ends!
		</div>
		<h4>The World of Assassins</h4>
		<div>
			It is a paranoid world out there. Everybody is out there to get you. Trust no one but yourself since everybody is a possible assassin.<br/>
			At the all times during the game, each player is assigned a target and has a specific time window to find and assassinate the target.<br/>
			If you take to long to find your target and complete the assassination you will be placed on the free-for-all wanted list; in which case you are pretty much dead.
		</div>
        <h4>Codewords</h4>
		<div>
			The codeword is the sacred secret you were entrusted with. Guard it with your life.
			Give the codeword only to the person that eliminates you.
		</div>
		<h4>Assassinating</h4>
		<div>
			Track down your target and when the right time comes...
			You can assassinate your target by using a melee or ranged weapon.
		</div>
		<h4>Weapons</h4>
		<div>
			You are only authorized to use two weapons:
            <ul>
            	<li>A spoon – touch your target with the curved side of the spoon</li>
            	<li>A sock – throw a <em>clean</em> rolled up sock at your target</li>
            </ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Self-Defense</h4>
		<div>
			Your are allowed to use a legal weapon defend yourself from your assassin if you catch them attempting to assassinate you.<br/>
			Make sure to get their codeword and then submit it as usual.
		</div>
		<h4>Safe Zones</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Target's Room</li>
				<li>Classes (only when in session)</li>
				<li>Office hours</li>
				<li>Restrooms - you really want to give them some space</li>
				<li>Places of religious worship</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Assassination report</h4>
		<div>
			Report an assassination on the website by typing in your target's codeword. Your new target will be assigned to you immediately (or you will be declared the winner).
		</div>
		<h4>Wanted List</h4>
		<div>
			When assassins take to long to complete an assassination they will be placed on the Wanted List.<br/>
			If you see someone on the Wanted List you are allowed to assassinate them extending you own time limit. 
		</div>
