        <h1>Stanford Assassins Rules</h1>
		<h4>Goal</h4>
		<div>
			Stay alive... If you can.
			The main goal of an assassins game is to be the last person alive when the game ends!
		</div>
		<h4>The World of Assassins</h4>
		<div>
			It is a dubious world out there. Everybody is out there to get you. Trust no one but yourself since everybody is a possible assassin.
			At the all times during the game each player is assigned a target and has a specific time window to find and assassinate the target. 
		</div>
        <h4>Codewords</h4>
		<div>
			The codeword is the sacred secret you were entrusted with. Guard it with your life.
			Give the codeword only to the person that eliminates you.
		</div>
		<h4>Assassinating</h4>
		<div>
			Track down your target and when the right time comes...
			You can assasasinate your target by using a melee or ranged weapon.
		</div>
		<h4>Weapons</h4>
		<div>
			You are only authorized to use two weapons:
            <ul>
            	<li>A spoon – touch your target with the curved side of the spoon</li>
            	<li>A sock – throw a <em>clean</em> rolled up sock at your target</li>
            </ul>
		</div>
        <!--
		<h4>Self-Protection</h4>
		<div>
			Watch your back...
			Your are allowed to use a designated weapon to perfom a self-defense kill if you notice sometone approaching for a kill.
		</div>
        -->
		<h4>Safe Zones</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Target's Room</li>
				<li>Classes (only when in session)</li>
				<li>Office hours</li>
				<li>Restrooms - you really want to give them some space</li>
				<li>Places of religious worship</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Assassination report</h4>
		<div>
			Report an assassination on the website by typing in your target's codeword. Your new target will be assigned to you immediately (or you will be declared the winner).
